A repo for the React frontend of my NC News site.

Please find a hosted version here: https://lighthearted-sawine-da4b68.netlify.app/

This site queries my backend API (https://github.com/Holquaria/backend-portfolio) and displays each article with comments from mock users.

The homepage will display a list of articles which can then be filtered by several parameters. Users can log in with a hard coded username and will then be able to comment, like and vote on articles.
